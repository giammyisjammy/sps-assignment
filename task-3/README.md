# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-3.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd task-3
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```bash
pnpm build
```

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes for cache busting.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
